# MCLauncher (Fork)

This tool allows you to install multiple versions of Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition (Bedrock) side-by-side.

## 🆕 Changes in This Fork

- ✅ **.NET 10** - Modern SDK-style project format
- ✅ **Single EXE** - Single file output with `dotnet publish`
- ✅ **GameStorageManager** - Downloads stored in `DownloadedMCAppx` folder
- ✅ **Search Box** - Filter versions by name (prefix match)
- ✅ **Auto Version Switch** - Automatically unregisters old version when launching new
- ✅ **Improved UX** - Download/removal confirmation dialogs
- ✅ **Version Detection** - Detects existing installations before download

## Disclaimer
This tool will **not** help you to pirate the game; it requires that you have a Microsoft account which can be used to download Minecraft from the Store.

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft account that **owns Minecraft for Windows 10**
- **Administrator permissions**
- **Developer mode** enabled in Windows Settings
- For beta versions: **Xbox Insider Hub** subscription

## Setup
1. Download from [Releases](https://github.com/bruhmomentumtr/mc-w10-version-launcher/releases)
2. Run `MCLauncher.exe`

## Building from Source

### Requirements
- .NET 10 SDK (or version matching `TargetFramework` in `.csproj`)

### Using Batch Scripts

The `bat/` folder contains ready-to-use build scripts:

| Script | Description | Size | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------|-------|
| `build-release.bat` | Compressed single EXE | ~67 MB | Slower startup |
| `build-release-uncompressed.bat` | Uncompressed single EXE | ~150 MB | Faster startup |
| `clean.bat` | Clean artifacts | - | - |

Scripts auto-detect target framework from `.csproj`.

### Manual Build

# Debug
dotnet build MCLauncher/MCLauncher.csproj

# Release (self-contained)
dotnet publish MCLauncher/MCLauncher.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true

# Release (small, requires .NET)
dotnet publish MCLauncher/MCLauncher.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false /p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

**Can I run multiple instances at the same time?**
No. You can install multiple versions, but only one can run at a time.
